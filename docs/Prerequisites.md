## Prerequisites



PyCript provides the flexibility to implement custom encryption and decryption algorithms using three distinct programming languages. To utilize PyCript, one must have at least one of these languages installed and properly configured in the user or system environment, enabling access from anywhere within the system.

* Python or Java or NodeJS + NPM
* Burp Suite configured with Jython to install the Python extension 


!!! info "Note"

    
    PyCript runs Python code directly without requiring the user to explicitly specify whether to use Python 2 or Python 3. It is important to ensure that the system is configured to use the desired version of Python when PyCript is executed.

    If you choose to use the Java programming language with PyCript, you will require a JAR file to be provided. Please ensure that you include the JAR file, and not the compiled class file or Java source code, when using PyCript.


!!! info "Note"

    When opting to utilize JavaScript with PyCript, it's essential to ensure that all necessary libraries are present in the folder where encryption and decryption files are stored. This is particularly important as many Node.js libraries require the presence of related dependencies in the same directory.
